intro: |
  I am a junior programmer who wants to grow in the IT industry. On this page you will find my projects that I have created in the course of 
  learning programming. I invite you to take a look at them.

about-me-01: |
  My adventure with programming began in late 2015 / 2016 when I was looking for a solution to control the heating of the house.
  There were ready-made solutions available on the market but they were available with the latest heating systems.
  I have an older generation heating system and could not find a suitable solution.
  I decided to write my own program that would meet my needs.
  This program is still working today and is constantly being developed.

  With time, more needs appeared and another project was created that made my life easier in my professional work, working as an international driver
  I had seemingly simple but time-consuming duties writing reports of lists of entries and exits from each country (EU requirements) which I decided to automate
  and I wrote an application that helped me with this and, by the way, kept track of work and rest times at a time when digital tachographs were just entering the market
  and everything had to be noted down manually in a notebook and still remember the time of work and rest in the last 28 days giving shortened weekly rests
  and many other duties that had to be fulfilled. I used this application from the beginning of 2016 until the end of 2024.
  The program also has copy protection takes the serial number of the motherboard runs it through an algorithm and checks if it matches the one stored in the program.

  The next stage of the programming adventure was to start volunteering in what used to be a club now an association of radio communications enthusiasts.
  At the club, I volunteered to help myself because the club's 10th anniversary was approaching and I wanted to help organize a graduation campaign to mark the occasion
  The club needed a homepage where you could see information about the upcoming anniversary and graduation campaign, and a cluster 
  (a form for entering established communications and a mechanism for counting points for established communications) 
  initially, due to lack of time and knowledge, I quickly set up the site on a ready-made template to gain time to build the cluster and the mechanism for counting points
  after the completion of the graduation campaign, I decided to write my own system for managing the club's website, and that's how the system was created,
  which still works today and is being developed.

  Another tiny project, but important to me because it was my first project for a company that needed a solution to monitor the work of a struc 
  Of course, there were many solutions on the market, but all of them required handling by an employee (readers for reflecting control points).
  system should be easy to use and the planer should not be able to bypass it or break it (readers can be dropped on the ground and can be damaged) I decided to write an application.
  I wrote a program that operates a bell switch as a control point for the presence of the planer at a given place and time, producing a report available on the phone 
  (in a browser) from off-site. The program written in 2023 / 2024 works and is used to this day every now and then I fix minor glitches.

project-01:
  title: Home heating control
  start-coding: The project started in 2017
 
  description-01: | 
    The program I wrote for my own use is used to control the underfloor heating at home, and controls the air intake to the fireplace in the living room
    which allows you to control the temperature in the water jacket in the fireplace, which is connected to the central heating, the program also switches the 3-way valve
    which changes the water circulation depending on whether we are burning in the fireplace or in a traditional stove in the boiler room.
    The program allows you to set the temperature in one room (the living room).
    The control is carried out via a remote desktop on a tablet or phone.
    It is possible to view the temperature itself on a TV with an HTML viewer.
    As you can see in the picture, data from the fireplace was added to the program so as you can guess in the plans for expansion.

  description-02: | 
    The whole program is written in Pascal in Delphi 7 environment with a bit of html for browser view and javascript (logging).
    The program runs on a desktop computer running Windows XP temperatures are taken using an adapter plugged into a com input to the adapter I plugged in 
    dallas ds18b20 sensors which have a built-in 16-bit ram memory with a unique id number, which allows to plug in many sensors to one com port.
    The program also has copy protection it takes the serial number of the motherboard runs it through an algorithm and checks if it matches the given key.

  description-03: |
    Initially, due to lack of knowledge of how to read data from sensors in Pascal language, I used a ready-made program (Logtemp) which read data from sensors and wrote them to an xml file every 
    them to an xml file at an interval of every 3 minutes and my program read this data from the xml file every 3 minutes and made calculations using a table made from a
    chart found on the web, which provided me with data on what the temperature of the floor heating should be depending on the outside temperature.
    Both programs I added to the auto start of the computer my program after starting had a special delay of a few seconds due to the reading of the xml file to avoid collision with the program logtmp
    As time influenced, my program developed and already read the data from the sensors by itself became more and more independent.
