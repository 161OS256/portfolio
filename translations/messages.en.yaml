  title: A few words about me
  description-01: |
    My adventure with programming began in late 2015 / early 2016 when I was looking for a solution to control my home heating.
    There were ready-made solutions available on the market but they were available with the latest heating systems.
    I have an older generation heating system and could not find a suitable solution.
    I decided to write my own program that would meet my needs.
    This program still works today and is constantly being developed.

  description-02: |
    Over time, more needs arose and another project was created that made my life easier in my professional work, working as an international driver
    I had seemingly simple but time-consuming duties such as writing reports of lists of entries and exits from each country (EU requirements), which I decided to automate
    and wrote an application that helped me with this and, by the way, kept track of work and rest times at a time when digital tachographs were just entering the market
    and everything had to be noted down manually in a notebook and still remember the time of work and rest in the last 28 days giving shortened weekly rests
    and many other duties that had to be fulfilled. I used this application from the beginning of 2016 until the end of 2024.

  description-03: |
    The next step in the programming adventure was to start volunteering at what used to be a club now called the Association of Radio Communications Enthusiasts.
    At the club, I volunteered to help myself because the club's 10th anniversary was approaching and I wanted to help organize a graduation campaign to mark the occasion.
    The club needed a home page where information about the upcoming anniversary and graduation campaign could be seen, as well as a cluster 
    (a form for entering established communications and a mechanism for counting points for established communications) 
    initially, due to lack of time and knowledge, I quickly set up the site on a ready-made template to gain time to build the cluster and the mechanism for counting points
    after the completion of the graduation campaign, I decided to write my own system for managing the club's website, and that's how the system was created, which still works today and is being developed.

  description-04: |
    Another project tiny but important to me because this is my first project for a company that needed a solution to monitor the work of a watchman in the company. On the 
    Of course, there were many solutions on the market, but all of them required operation by an employee (readers for bouncing checkpoints) the requirement was that the
    system be easy to use and that the watchman could not bypass it or break it (the reader can be dropped on the ground and can be damaged). I decided to write an application.
    I wrote a program that operates the bell switch as a checkpoint for the watchman's presence at a given place and time making a report available on the phone 
    (in a browser) from off-site. The program written in 2023 / 2024 works and is still used today.

  description-01: | 
    I wrote the program for my own use. It serves me to control the underfloor heating in the house and controls the air intake to the fireplace in the living room.
    It allows me to control the temperature of the water jacket in the fireplace, which is connected to the central heating. The program also switches the 3-way valve,
    which changes the water circulation depending on whether you are burning in the fireplace or in a traditional stove in the boiler room.
    The program allows you to set the temperature in one room (the living room).
    It is controlled via a remote desktop on a tablet or phone.
    It is possible to view the temperature itself on a TV with an HTML viewer. 
    As you can see in the picture, the data from the fireplace was added to the program so as you can guess in the plans for expansion.

  description-02: | 
    The entire program is written in Pascal in the Delphi 7 environment with a bit of HTML for the browser view and Javascript (logging).
    The program runs on a desktop computer running Windows XP. Temperatures are taken using an adapter plugged into the com input to the adapter I plugged in 
    dallas ds18b20 sensors, which have a built-in 16-bit ram memory, which contains a unique ID number which allows multiple sensors to be plugged into one com port.
    The program also has copy protection. It takes the serial number of the motherboard, runs it through an algorithm and checks if it matches the key provided.

  description-03: |
    Initially, for lack of knowledge, how to read data from sensors in Pascal language. I used an off-the-shelf program (Logtemp) that read the data from the sensors and wrote them 
    them to an xml file at an interval of every 3 minutes and my program read this data from the xml file every 3 minutes and made calculations using a table made from a
    chart found on the web, which provided me with data on what the floor heating temperature should be depending on the outside temperature.
    I added both programs to the computer's auto start. My program, upon startup, had a special delay of a few seconds due to the reading of the xml file to avoid 
    collision with the logtmp program. As time went on, I improved my program to read the data from the sensors by itself and became more independent.

  start-coding: The project started in 2016r.

  description-01: | 
    When writing this application in 2016 I knew little about object-oriented programming.Therefore, the application was still written structurally. 
    I stopped using this app at the end of 2024 with the end of my driving career.
    In spite of appearances, it was quite extensive. It had many tabs and functionalities. 
    The essence of the matter was for the application to serve its purpose. Front-end issues 
    were not the most important, as the app was only for personal use. 

  description-02: |
    The main goal of the project was to build a smart ala notepad. 
    So that during the day we could enter relevant annotations one by one, which would later be automatically processed and entered into the relevant reports.
    In the “Start View” image you can see a simple view of entering the start date. In the view, I wanted large buttons because I planned to 
    use the application on a 7-inch tablet. And this was the simple way I entered the basic data into the mini system. 
  description-03: | 
    After starting the day on the main view, the program showed until what time I could
    day to work. It took into account the used breaks for the week as you can see in the image “Main view of the application”, Pauses 9h (2). This means that I have to 
    used two breaks of 9 hours, and this meant that I could work 15h. Since the work and daily rest time (overnight) had to
    fit into 24h.
  description-04: | 
    If the counter indicated 0 in such a case I had to apply a break after work not 9 but 11 hours. Which at the same time reduced the possibility of working up to 13h.
    This is just 1 of the simplest issues like keeping track of how many times I had already reduced my working hours. Things got much more complicated when I had to shorten the 
    weekly rest (weekend). The full one was no less than 45 hours (often especially abroad weekends were shortened to a minimum of 24 hours).
  description-05: | 
    In this case, the difference between the full and shortened weekly rest had to be given no later than the end of the third week
    of the shortened weekly rest. About these deadlines and the number of hours to be given back with due notice, the application conscientiously reminded me. 
    As you can see in the image “Information about weekends to be turned in and finances” more functionality is revealed. If only such as finances.
    
  description-06: |  
    This is about balances of business advances in three currencies and an overview calculation of salary.
    In the image in question, you can see a search engine for searching in notes and a “BackUp,” or backup, which allowed the database to be restored
    after a device failure. Each day, after the work was completed and the last annotations were made, the “End of Day” image created an automatic backup.
  description-07: |
    The last 4 backups were retained and the earlier ones were automatically deleted by the script. Time for a little tour of the application starting 
    from the “Main view of the application” / 'Take a note' / will take us to the “Enter notes” tab Here we see only three input fields but
    here one field has more than one use. E.g. In the field 'Time' when the time was found then the corresponding procedures applied. 
  description-08: |
    That is, 'Locality' was used in the 'Pallet Exchange' tab where the exchange was made and as a simple note.
    If in the 'Time' field I entered the keyword “Chiller” then in the 'Locality' field I entered the liters of fuel refueled for the chiller.
    And in the 'Notes' field, the status of the motor hour counter. This data traveled to the database and later a report was created from this data.
    In the 'Pallet Replacement' card you can see the 'Locality' loaded from memory. 
  description-09: |
    In the 'Notes' field, I entered the name of the company where the pallet exchange was made. This information wandered to a separate table in the database and later from this data
    pallet exchange report was created. In this tab you can see a module for sending the report and previewing previous reports. This module sent to the employer 
    information about pallet exchange and settlement of business expenses. You can see the preview of the reports in the image “Preview of pallet exchange reports”.
  
  description-10: |
    After returning from the 'Pallet Exchange' tab to the 'Main Application View'. Navigate to the 'information entries' tab “Information about weekends to donate and finances”.
    From this tab, go to 'Previous entries' to the 'Notes preview' tab. From this tab, I sent reports such as a summary of notes to my email address
    'Send report to email. 
  description-11: |
    I also sent records of crossing national borders (EU regulations), and information about refueling the refrigeration unit. In the tab “Application main view”
    we see a button with information on how many days are left until the deadline 'Deadline in 5 days'.
    The button will take us to the 'Term Preview' tab where I applied the classic 'CRUD' (Create, Read, Update, Delete) i.e. adding a new term, 
    read appointments, update (edit) an appointment, and delete an appointment.
  description-12: |
    Returning to the “Preview pallet exchange reports” tab, the 'Pallet exchange information' table shows a 'Signature' box. These links allowed you to sign the transfer 
    or retrieval of pallets from another driver from the same company. I used the 'Canvas' library for the signature, which can be seen in the images “Signing pallet exchange”
    and “Signature in pallet exchange table”.
  description-13: |
    In the “Application main view” tab, there was one last detail left to describe 'Pause 3h', which was due to the regulations that could be used at work.
    During the day when I had an unscheduled break (longer than 3h) 
    I could apply a full combined daily rest of 3h + 9h after work, which was treated as a full 11-hour daily rest.
  description-14: | 
    That's all I wanted to describe in this application. I have presented here the most relevant issues from my point of view.
