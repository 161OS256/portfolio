  intro: |
    I would like to grow in the IT industry. I am interested in the position of Junior Programmer. On this page you will find my projects that I have created while learning programming.
    I invite you to familiarize yourself with them.

  title: A few words about me

    My adventure with programming began in late 2015 / early 2016 when I was looking for a solution to control my home heating.
    There were ready-made solutions available on the market but they were available with the latest heating systems.
    I have an older generation heating system and could not find a suitable solution.
    I decided to write my own program that would meet my needs.
    This program still works today and is constantly being developed.

    Over time, more needs arose and another project was created that made my life easier in my professional work, working as an international driver
    I had seemingly simple but time-consuming duties such as writing reports of lists of entries and exits from each country (EU requirements), which I decided to automate
    and wrote an application that helped me with this and, by the way, kept track of work and rest times at a time when digital tachographs were just entering the market
    and everything had to be noted down manually in a notebook and still remember the time of work and rest in the last 28 days giving shortened weekly rests
    and many other duties that had to be fulfilled. I used this application from the beginning of 2016 until the end of 2024.

    The next step in the programming adventure was to start volunteering at what used to be a club now called the Association of Radio Communications Enthusiasts.
    At the club, I volunteered to help myself because the club's 10th anniversary was approaching and I wanted to help organize a graduation campaign to mark the occasion.
    The club needed a home page where information about the upcoming anniversary and graduation campaign could be seen, as well as a cluster 
    (a form for entering established communications and a mechanism for counting points for established communications) 
    initially, due to lack of time and knowledge, I quickly set up the site on a ready-made template to gain time to build the cluster and the mechanism for counting points
    after the completion of the graduation campaign, I decided to write my own system for managing the club's website, and that's how the system was created, which still works today and is being developed.

    Another project tiny but important to me because this is my first project for a company that needed a solution to monitor the work of a watchman in the company. On the 
    Of course, there were many solutions on the market, but all of them required operation by an employee (readers for bouncing checkpoints) the requirement was that the
    system be easy to use and that the watchman could not bypass it or break it (the reader can be dropped on the ground and can be damaged). I decided to write an application.
    I wrote a program that operates the bell switch as a checkpoint for the watchman's presence at a given place and time making a report available on the phone 
    (in a browser) from off-site. The program written in 2023 / 2024 works and is still used today.

    I wrote the program for my own use. It serves me to control the underfloor heating in the house and controls the air intake to the fireplace in the living room.
    It allows me to control the temperature of the water jacket in the fireplace, which is connected to the central heating. The program also switches the 3-way valve,
    which changes the water circulation depending on whether you are burning in the fireplace or in a traditional stove in the boiler room.
    The program allows you to set the temperature in one room (the living room).
    It is controlled via a remote desktop on a tablet or phone.
    It is possible to view the temperature itself on a TV with an HTML viewer. 
    As you can see in the picture, the data from the fireplace was added to the program so as you can guess in the plans for expansion.

    The entire program is written in Pascal in the Delphi 7 environment with a bit of HTML for the browser view and Javascript (logging).
    The program runs on a desktop computer running Windows XP. Temperatures are taken using an adapter plugged into the com input to the adapter I plugged in 
    dallas ds18b20 sensors, which have a built-in 16-bit ram memory, which contains a unique ID number which allows multiple sensors to be plugged into one com port.
    The program also has copy protection. It takes the serial number of the motherboard, runs it through an algorithm and checks if it matches the key provided.

    Initially, for lack of knowledge, how to read data from sensors in Pascal language. I used an off-the-shelf program (Logtemp) that read the data from the sensors and wrote them 
    them to an xml file at an interval of every 3 minutes and my program read this data from the xml file every 3 minutes and made calculations using a table made from a
    chart found on the web, which provided me with data on what the floor heating temperature should be depending on the outside temperature.
    I added both programs to the computer's auto start. My program, upon startup, had a special delay of a few seconds due to the reading of the xml file to avoid 
    collision with the logtmp program. As time went on, I improved my program to read the data from the sensors by itself and became more independent.

    When writing this app in 2016 I didn't know much about object-oriented so the app still written structurally. 
    At the end of 2024 I stopped using this application with the end of my driving career.
    In spite of appearances it was quite extensive many tabs and functionality. The main goal of the project was to build a smart ala notepad. 
    So that during the day I could enter relevant annotations one by one. The essence of the matter was for the application to fulfill its role. Frontend issues 
    were not the most important because the application was only for personal use.

    A project created in Symfony (version 6.4.19). 
    The application is based on the MVC pattern and uses Twig templates to render views.

    Frontend - Bootstrap: In the project I used Bootstrap to build responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.
    Thanks to Bootstrap, the app adapts to different screen sizes,
    which provides an optimal experience on mobile devices, tablets and desktops.
