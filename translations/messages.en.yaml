  title: A few words about me
  description-01: |
    My adventure with programming began in late 2015 / early 2016 when I was looking for a solution to control my home heating.
    There were ready-made solutions available on the market but they were available with the latest heating systems.
    I have an older generation heating system and could not find a suitable solution.
    I decided to write my own program that would meet my needs.
    This program still works today and is constantly being developed.

  description-02: |
    Over time, more needs arose and another project was created that made my life easier in my professional work, working as an international driver
    I had seemingly simple but time-consuming duties such as writing reports of lists of entries and exits from each country (EU requirements), which I decided to automate
    and wrote an application that helped me with this and, by the way, kept track of work and rest times at a time when digital tachographs were just entering the market
    and everything had to be noted down manually in a notebook and still remember the time of work and rest in the last 28 days giving shortened weekly rests
    and many other duties that had to be fulfilled. I used this application from the beginning of 2016 until the end of 2024.

  description-03: |
    The next step in the programming adventure was to start volunteering at what used to be a club now called the Association of Radio Communications Enthusiasts.
    At the club, I volunteered to help myself because the club's 10th anniversary was approaching and I wanted to help organize a graduation campaign to mark the occasion.
    The club needed a home page where information about the upcoming anniversary and graduation campaign could be seen, as well as a cluster 
    (a form for entering established communications and a mechanism for counting points for established communications) 
    initially, due to lack of time and knowledge, I quickly set up the site on a ready-made template to gain time to build the cluster and the mechanism for counting points
    after the completion of the graduation campaign, I decided to write my own system for managing the club's website, and that's how the system was created, which still works today and is being developed.

  description-04: |
    Another project tiny but important to me because this is my first project for a company that needed a solution to monitor the work of a watchman in the company. On the 
    Of course, there were many solutions on the market, but all of them required operation by an employee (readers for bouncing checkpoints) the requirement was that the
    system be easy to use and that the watchman could not bypass it or break it (the reader can be dropped on the ground and can be damaged). I decided to write an application.
    I wrote a program that operates the bell switch as a checkpoint for the watchman's presence at a given place and time making a report available on the phone 
    (in a browser) from off-site. The program written in 2023 / 2024 works and is still used today.

  title: Home heating control.
  title-nav: Home heating
  start-coding: The project started in 2015
 
  description-01: | 
    I wrote the program for my own use. It serves me to control the underfloor heating in the house and controls the air intake to the fireplace in the living room.
    It allows me to control the temperature of the water jacket in the fireplace, which is connected to the central heating. The program also switches the 3-way valve,
    which changes the water circulation depending on whether you are burning in the fireplace or in a traditional stove in the boiler room.
    The program allows you to set the temperature in one room (the living room).
    It is controlled via a remote desktop on a tablet or phone.
    It is possible to view the temperature itself on a TV with an HTML viewer. 
    As you can see in the picture, the data from the fireplace was added to the program so as you can guess in the plans for expansion.

  description-02: | 
    The entire program is written in Pascal in the Delphi 7 environment with a bit of HTML for the browser view and Javascript (logging).
    The program runs on a desktop computer running Windows XP. Temperatures are taken using an adapter plugged into the com input to the adapter I plugged in 
    dallas ds18b20 sensors, which have a built-in 16-bit ram memory, which contains a unique ID number which allows multiple sensors to be plugged into one com port.
    The program also has copy protection. It takes the serial number of the motherboard, runs it through an algorithm and checks if it matches the key provided.

  description-03: |
    Initially, for lack of knowledge, how to read data from sensors in Pascal language. I used an off-the-shelf program (Logtemp) that read the data from the sensors and wrote them 
    them to an xml file at an interval of every 3 minutes and my program read this data from the xml file every 3 minutes and made calculations using a table made from a
    chart found on the web, which provided me with data on what the floor heating temperature should be depending on the outside temperature.
    I added both programs to the computer's auto start. My program, upon startup, had a special delay of a few seconds due to the reading of the xml file to avoid 
    collision with the logtmp program. As time went on, I improved my program to read the data from the sensors by itself and became more independent.

  description-01: | 
    When writing this application in 2016 I knew little about object-oriented programming.Therefore, the application was still written structurally. 
    I stopped using this app at the end of 2024 with the end of my driving career.
    In spite of appearances, it was quite extensive. It had many tabs and functionalities. 
    The essence of the matter was for the application to serve its purpose. Front-end issues 
    were not the most important, as the app was only for personal use. 

  description-02: |
    The main goal of the project was to build a smart ala notepad. 
    So that during the day we could enter relevant annotations one by one, which would later be automatically processed and entered into the relevant reports.
    In the “Start View” image you can see a simple view of entering the start date. In the view, I wanted large buttons because I planned to 
    use the application on a 7-inch tablet. And this was the simple way I entered the basic data into the mini system. 
  description-03: | 
    After starting the day on the main view, the program showed until what time I could
    day to work. It took into account the used breaks for the week as you can see in the image “Main view of the application”, Pauses 9h (2). This means that I have to 
    used two breaks of 9 hours, and this meant that I could work 15h. Since the work and daily rest time (overnight) had to
    fit into 24h.
  description-04: | 
    If the counter indicated 0 in such a case I had to apply a break after work not 9 but 11 hours. Which at the same time reduced the possibility of working up to 13h.
    This is just 1 of the simplest issues like keeping track of how many times I had already reduced my working hours. Things got much more complicated when I had to shorten the 
    weekly rest (weekend). The full one was no less than 45 hours (often especially abroad weekends were shortened to a minimum of 24 hours).
  description-05: | 
    In this case, the difference between the full and shortened weekly rest had to be given no later than the end of the third week
    of the shortened weekly rest. About these deadlines and the number of hours to be given back with due notice, the application conscientiously reminded me. 
    As you can see in the image “Information about weekends to be turned in and finances” more functionality is revealed. If only such as finances.
    
  description-06: |  
    This is about balances of business advances in three currencies and an overview calculation of salary.
    In the image in question, you can see a search engine for searching in notes and a “BackUp,” or backup, which allowed the database to be restored
    after a device failure. Each day, after the work was completed and the last annotations were made, the “End of Day” image created an automatic backup.
  description-07: |
    The last 4 backups were retained and the earlier ones were automatically deleted by the script. Time for a little tour of the application starting 
    from the “Main view of the application” / 'Take a note' / will take us to the “Enter notes” tab Here we see only three input fields but
    here one field has more than one use. E.g. In the field 'Time' when the time was found then the corresponding procedures applied. 
  description-08: |
    That is, 'Locality' was used in the 'Pallet Exchange' tab where the exchange was made and as a simple note.
    If in the 'Time' field I entered the keyword “Chiller” then in the 'Locality' field I entered the liters of fuel refueled for the chiller.
    And in the 'Notes' field, the status of the motor hour counter. This data traveled to the database and later a report was created from this data.
    In the 'Pallet Replacement' card you can see the 'Locality' loaded from memory. 
  description-09: |
    In the 'Notes' field, I entered the name of the company where the pallet exchange was made. This information wandered to a separate table in the database and later from this data
    pallet exchange report was created. In this tab you can see a module for sending the report and previewing previous reports. This module sent to the employer 
    information about pallet exchange and settlement of business expenses. You can see the preview of the reports in the image “Preview of pallet exchange reports”.
  
  description-10: |
    After returning from the 'Pallet Exchange' tab to the 'Main Application View'. Navigate to the 'information entries' tab “Information about weekends to donate and finances”.
    From this tab, go to 'Previous entries' to the 'Notes preview' tab. From this tab, I sent reports such as a summary of notes to my email address
    'Send report to email. 
  description-11: |
    I also sent records of crossing national borders (EU regulations), and information about refueling the refrigeration unit. In the tab “Application main view”
    we see a button with information on how many days are left until the deadline 'Deadline in 5 days'.
    The button will take us to the 'Term Preview' tab where I applied the classic 'CRUD' (Create, Read, Update, Delete) i.e. adding a new term, 
    read appointments, update (edit) an appointment, and delete an appointment.
  description-12: |
    Returning to the “Preview pallet exchange reports” tab, the 'Pallet exchange information' table shows a 'Signature' box. These links allowed you to sign the transfer 
    or retrieval of pallets from another driver from the same company. I used the 'Canvas' library for the signature, which can be seen in the images “Signing pallet exchange”
    and “Signature in pallet exchange table”.
  description-13: |
    In the “Application main view” tab, there was one last detail left to describe 'Pause 3h', which was due to the regulations that could be used at work.
    During the day when I had an unscheduled break (longer than 3h) 
    I could apply a full combined daily rest of 3h + 9h after work, which was treated as a full 11-hour daily rest.
  description-14: | 
    That's all I wanted to describe in this application. I have presented here the most relevant issues from my point of view.

    On this page we see two interesting elements, the first of which is the “orange carousel.” It shows the active stations, and in the absence of them 
    the carousel shows the results of the year-long contest. The second interesting element is a map that shows radio communications from the last hour.
    When you click on the station icon, you will see information about the communications and the linked radio sign. If there is a lot of activity, when there are a lot of connections on the map,
    by clicking on the linked radio sign in the balloon, we will see the filtered communications of only that one station on the map, which can be seen in the images 
    “Before filtering” and ‘After filtering’.

  description-02: |
    The login to the form is done using the forum. Originally the cluster was to be used only for club members, so I used a session variable for logging in
    phpBB forum. The form handling is, of course, the classic “CRUD” (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Underneath there are more complicated mechanisms
    such as the implementation of QSL cards (a picture in the form of a postcard confirming connectivity). These are downloadable directly from the cluster itself image “Cluster”.

  description-03: |
    In the cluster, in addition to downloadable cards, we can preview a given link on a map. Returning to the topic of the cluster form and what else is hidden underneath-.
    in the Association there are sometimes all sorts of contests, graduation actions, activations, and here are needed mechanisms to handle these issues.
    For this purpose, I created an administrative panel for initiating such events - image “Cluster administrative panel”.

  description-04: |
    The administration panel supports graduation actions, to which a QSL card special for the occasion can be assigned. Particularly troublesome in the structural code 
    proved to be the handling of the ability to complete entries after the action is completed. Since the user needs time to add the last
    communications after the graduation action time is over. Communications entered after the completed action with a date that falls within the action had to be accepted.
    The image “Cluster Administration Panel” shows a table, in which the 'Uzup' column is visible, in this column are the number of hours spent
    for completing outstanding entries.

  description-05: |
    In later graduation actions, as you can see, functionality was added consisting of differentiated scoring. The differentiated scoring depended on 
    whether the communication was within the country, or outside the country where the station was stationed, or outside Europe. The rubrics 'Wob' meaning within one's own country,
    'Poz', i.e. outside the country in which the station is stationed, and 'DX', i.e. communications going beyond Europe. Support for this functionality consisted in processing 
    a string variable, an example of a character from the CB band, e.g. '161OS256' (that is, we have a string and look for an item in it that is not a number, we cut off the rest and we have a squadron number).
    This number determines what country the station is broadcasting from, so all we had to do was enter the list of squadrons belonging to Europe into the base. And that's how the points were calculated.
    If the respondent has a different squadron than mine then we check if he is on the list of European squadrons if yes:he gets 2 points and otherwise 3. 
    Going back to the cluster form, in the early stages of development one of the first functionalities was to make it easier to locate the respondent. 

  description-06: |
    If the respondent belonged to a 
    club and agreed to share the location of his station, then if the user entered the sign of such operator in the form, he received the information
    'Locator in database'. This meant that the station's location was stored in the database and the respondent did not need to be asked where it was transmitting from.
    The last important detail of the whole system that remained to be described in this project is the Android Application. Looking at the “QSO Form” one can imagine 
    operating this form on the slim screen of a smartphone. Initially, I planned to write a version of the form for mobile devices. What I do not hide in the future 
    after the migration of the whole system to symfony will take place. In order not to waste time then when I didn't have much of it, I decided to compromise. Instead of writing a mobile
    version of the form I decided to write an application for Android. Because I got the idea to use the GPS in the smartphone to locate mobile stations.
    For this I used a very easy platform “MIT App Inventor”, which is used to teach programming to children. 
    This platform allowed me to use the GPS from the device to update the location in the background with the screen off so that the device would not consume too much power.
    The app is available in the store

  start-coding: Project started in 2024.
  description-01: |  
    This is by far the smallest project I have done not counting the projects done while learning from various courses.
    I made the project in Pascal language in the “Delphi 7” environment. The task was relatively simple from the coding side, it was enough to write a 
    program that would handle the com port and receive signals from the appropriate pins. I made the electronics myself, which handled the 
    the control point. The system consisted of 2 bell switches mounted in the company, each switch had a light that 
    began to flicker when it was time to make the rounds. Then a button had to be pressed, the program from the moment the flickering light was activated,
    began listening on the com port in a loop at 1 sec intervals. When the button was pressed, the program picked up the signal after which it 
    deactivated the lamp flicker. Before the next round before the next time the lamp flicker was activated, the program checked the status of the port,
    whether the switch contacts were open (in case the watchman got the idea to immobilize the button permanently in the pressed position).
    In such a case, such an event was noted in the report. 
    
  description-02: |
    The logic of the program relied on a timer, as the original plan was to celebrate every hour, cyclically.
    Every hour there was an activation of a flickering light for a specified period of time. If the button was pressed within the specified time, the celebration was credited,
    otherwise, the rounds - not credited (which was noted in the report). In addition, the system was equipped with an orange flickering light
    located in such a way as to be visible from the gatehouse, the light was activated only when there was little time left for rounds.
    as a reminder. After launching the system, I received information that there was no need to make rounds every hour, so I added to the interface
    24 check boxes so that the company could set which hours to make rounds.

  description-03: |
    The program is equipped with a mini server that allows viewing an HTML file with a list of reports by date. A new report with a new date is generated every day.
    The owner of the company can access the report on his phone from off-site.
