  My adventure with programming began in late 2015 / 2016 when I was looking for a solution to control the heating of the house.
  There were ready-made solutions available on the market but they were available with the latest heating systems.
  I have an older generation heating system and could not find a suitable solution.
  I decided to write my own program that would meet my expectations.
  This program still works today and meets my expectations and is constantly being developed.

  With time, more needs appeared and another project was created that made my life easier in my professional work, working as an international driver
  I had seemingly simple but time-consuming duties writing reports of lists of entries and exits from each country (EU requirements) which I decided to automate
  and I wrote an application that helped me with this and, by the way, kept track of work and rest times at a time when digital tachographs were just entering the market
  and everything had to be noted down manually in a notebook and still remember the time of work and rest in the last 28 days giving shortened weekly rests
  and many other duties that had to be fulfilled. I used this application from the beginning of 2016 until the end of 2024.

  The next stage of the programming adventure was to start volunteering in what used to be a club now an association of radio communications enthusiasts.
  At the club, I volunteered to help myself because the club's 10th anniversary was approaching and I wanted to help organize a graduation campaign to mark the occasion
  The club needed a homepage where you could see information about the upcoming anniversary and graduation campaign, and a cluster 
  (a form for entering established communications and a mechanism for counting points for established communications) 
  initially, due to lack of time and knowledge, I quickly set up the site on a ready-made template to gain time to build the cluster and the mechanism for counting points
  after the completion of the graduation campaign, I decided to write my own system for managing the club's website, and that's how the system was created,
  which still works today and is being developed.

  Another tiny project, but important to me because it was my first project for a company that needed a solution to monitor the work of a struc 
  Of course, there were many solutions on the market, but all of them required handling by an employee (readers for reflecting control points).
  system should be easy to use and the planer should not be able to bypass it or break it (readers can be dropped on the ground and can be damaged) I decided to write an application.
  I wrote a program that operates a bell switch as a control point for the presence of the planer at a given place and time, producing a report available on the phone 
  (in a browser) from off-site. The program written in 2023 / 2024 works and is used to this day every now and then I fix minor glitches.

project-01:
  title: "Home heating control"
  start-coding: "The project started in 2017"
 
  description: | 
    The program I wrote for my own purposes is used to control the underfloor heating at home, and controls the air intake to the fireplace in the living room
    which allows you to control the temperature in the water jacket in the fireplace, which is connected to the central heating.
    
    The program allows you to set the temperature in one room (the living room).
    The control is carried out via a remote desktop on a tablet or phone.
    It is possible to view the temperature itself on a TV with an HTML viewer.
